# SR-electrolytes
Symbolic Regression on High-throughput electrolyte data.

This repositrory contains modules and an example to train symbolic regression models, following the methodology in the article:  

 *Eibar Flores et al. (2022), Learning the laws of electrolyte transport using symbolic regression, DOI: [xxxx]().*


## Interactive plot of model predictions
We have set-up a small site with an interactive plot illustrating the predictions of the model foun in the article. To visit follow this link: [EFlores2022_SR2022](https://big-map.github.io/SR-electrolytes/)

## How to use
We have drafted a Jupyter Notebook explaining how to use the modules. You can find it [here](./example_use.ipynb). The modules use the following dependencies:
* numpy
* sympy
* pandas
* scikit-learn
* autofeat  

## Aknowledgements
This project has received funding from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 957189.
